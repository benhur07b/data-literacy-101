This website aims to present, introduce, and provide a general overview of the fundamentals of data literacy in a way that is approachable and easy to understand. The fields of data and data literacy are vast and this website represents only a fraction of all the available knowledge and information. Be that as it may, the author hopes that this will serve as a good starting point for anyone interested in learning about open data, data literacy, and how these concepts can be applied in the work that they do.

### Using the website

## About me
I am free and open stuff advocate from the Philippines who works at the intersections of the openness, data, technology, and geospatial fields. I am an alumnus of the [School of Data](https://schoolofdata.org) Fellowship and Data Expert Programme with 8+ years of experience providing training, support, and consulting services on data literacy and free and open source software for geospatial (FOSS4G) applications to individuals, government agencies, the private sector, and civil society. 

I support and take an active role in the open data and open mapping communities in the Philippines as an individual and through [BNHR](https://bnhr.xyz), my open data and open geospatial consultancy, and SmartCT, a tech non-profit that I co-founded. You can find me online on my [website](https://bnhr.xyz/) and on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/bnhr.xyz), [YouTube (subscribe)](https://www.youtube.com/c/BNHRdotXYZ?sub_confirmation=1), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/BNHRdotXYZ), and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@benhur07b).
