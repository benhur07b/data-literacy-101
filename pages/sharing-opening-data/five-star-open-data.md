# Five-star open data
- Suggested by Sir Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the WWW) as a deployment scheme for open data.
- Stars are awarded according to the state of open data from data released under an open license to data linked to other datasets.
- Provides a good framework for assessing where you are in terms of opening your data and what steps to take in order to move forward.

## ☆ data
> Data is available (in whatever format) under an open license

- [+] You can look, print, and download data.
- [+] You can share data with others.
- [-] If data is locked-up in a non machine-readable format (pdf, doc, jpeg), it’s hard to get data out of the document.	

**As a publisher...** 
- [+] It’s simple to publish.

## ☆☆ data
> Data is available as structured, machine-readable data (e.g. Excel instead of PDFs)

### Costs [-] and benefits [+]
**As a consumer...**
- [+] You can do all you can with ☆ data.
- [+] You can directly process the data or export it to another structured format.
- [-] You might need proprietary software to work with data.

**As a publisher...**

## ☆☆☆ data
> Data is available in a non-proprietary open format (e.g. CSV instead of Excel)

### Costs [-] and benefits [+]

## ☆☆☆☆ data
> Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is used to identify things

### Costs [-] and benefits [+]
**As a consumer...**
- [+] You can do all you can with ☆☆☆ data.
- [+] You can link, bookmark, and reuse parts of the data since it is now data in the web.

**As a publisher...** 
- [+] Other publishers can link to your data.
- [+] More granular control over your data.
- [-] You need to assign URIs to data items and think about how best to represent them.
- [-] You need to understand the structure of W3C standards.

## ☆☆☆☆☆ data
> Data is linked to other data in order to provide context

### Costs [-] and benefits [+]
**As a consumer...**
- [+] You can do all you can with ☆☆☆☆ data.
- [+] You can discover other related data easier.
- [-] Possibility for broken links.
