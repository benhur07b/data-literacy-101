# Co-creation

## People before systems
### Design for people
> “If you design for everyone, you delight no one. That is the recipe for a mediocre product.” (Alan Cooper)

### Engage early and engage often
- Identify your key stakeholders and assumptions early.
    - Persona exercises
- Identify the needs and use-cases of your stakeholders.
    - User stories, Journey mapping
- Give your users a say in the design and development process
    - Co-creation, Design sprints
- Validate your assumptions with actual users
- Iterate

### Utilize user and people-centered design tools
- Persona exercises
- User Stories
- Journey Mapping
- UI Sketching

### Ensure data is used after release
- Provide incentive for users to use the data.
- Focus on telling compelling stories rather than just the data.
- Forge collaborations among the data users and data providers.
- Build grassroots communities around open data.

## Co-creation isn't
- Putting different people in one room and expecting them to generate a solution themselves.
- Gathering and consolidating ideas from different people.
- Finding the “middle-ground” solution between stakeholders who have varying, and oftentimes competing, interests.

## Co-creation is
- Confronting the inherent power relations and inequalities between your stakeholders. Those who have more must be willing to give-up more and those with the most to lose should have a say in things.
- Acknowledging historical injustices and their present-day impacts.
- Helping everyone develop a shared point of view no matter how difficult it is.
