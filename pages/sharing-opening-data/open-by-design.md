# Open by design

## Be open by default
- **Assumption is open first** then find restrictions (not the other way around).
    - For example, we assume that government data and data funded by public funds should be open by default.
    - From this rule, we apply exceptions on what data we need to protect.
        - Information protected by the Constitution and statutes (e.g. national security, personally-identifiable information)
        - Ethical considerations of data (e.g. indigenous communities, sensitive information)
    - It shouldn’t be the other way around where we close all our data at the start and just find which data we can open/share.
- Aside from ethical and legal considerations (e.g. constitutionally and statutorily protected data), **public data and data collected by public institutions should be open**.

## Add mechanisms and protections to ensure and facilitate openness
- Give [**permission in advance**](../open-data/what-is-open.html#permission-in-advance)
- Don’t make it hard to work with your data or tech. Make it **available** and **discoverable**.
- Use **open [standards](../open-data/data-standards.html)** and practice interoperability.
- **Prefer open source** instead of proprietary and closed solutions.
- [**Use an open license**](open-licenses.html).
- [**Co-develop and co-create from the start**](co-creation.html). Don’t make it hard for people to collaborate with you
