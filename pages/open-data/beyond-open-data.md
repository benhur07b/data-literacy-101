# Beyond open data

## Frictionless data

The **Frictionless Data** project aims to reduce common data workflow issues (called *friction*) thus making working with data seamless, easy, and frictionless. It is a progressive open-source framework for building data infrastructure—data management, data integration, data flows, etc.—and includes various data standards and software to work with data.

Frictionless can be used to describe data (add metadata and schemas), validate data, and transform data. Custom data standards can also be written based on the Frictionless specifications. For example, you can use Frictionless to:
- easily add metadata to your data before you publish it.
- quickly validate your data to check the data quality before you share it.
- build a declarative pipeline to clean and process data before analyzing it.

## FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles
> The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’ intend to provide guidelines to improve the **Findability**, **Accessibility**, **Interoperability**, and **Reuse** of digital assets.
>
> The principles emphasise machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data. ([FAIR Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), GO FAIR)

## CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) principles
>  Existing principles within the open data movement (e.g. FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. The emphasis on greater data sharing alone creates a tension for Indigenous Peoples who are also asserting greater control over the application and use of Indigenous data and Indigenous Knowledge for collective benefit. 
>
>The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance are **people and purpose-oriented**, reflecting the **crucial role of data in advancing Indigenous innovation and self-determination**. These principles **complement the existing FAIR principles** encouraging open and other data movements to consider both people and purpose in their advocacy and pursuits.
