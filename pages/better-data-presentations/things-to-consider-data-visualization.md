# Things to consider

## Start at the beginning
- Begin bar charts at zero for a more accurate and truthful comparison of data.
- Truncating the Y-axis may lead to misrepresentation of the data that can mislead your audience.

## Avoid distorting charts
- Line charts are great at showing trends but are sensitive to changes in the size of the chart.
- Stretching the height will tend to overplay (or overestimate) the changes or trend.
- Stretching the height will tend to underplay (or underestimate) the changes or trend.

## Use pie charts sparingly
- Keep the number of categories to 5 or less.
- Don't use the pie for comparison—e.g. comparing the number of procurements per year
- Triple-check that the total value of your pie is exactly 100%.
- Don't make things worse by putting the pie in 3D.
- Pie charts are great at showing or highlighting one share of the total.
- Bar charts work great as substitutes for pie charts.

## Use colors deliberately
- Use color for communication mostly and for decoration sparingly.
- Too many colors can confuse or disorient.
- Be mindful of your choices of color so you can create inclusive visualizations—e.g. color-blind friendly visulas, etc. 
- There are online tools that can help you create color palettes and combinations that are inclusive, beautiful, and just work—e.g. [Color Brewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/), [Viz Palette](https://projects.susielu.com/viz-palette)

## Keep right
- Align whole numbers flush right to make it easy to find and compare them.
- Similarly, you can align decimals usind their decimal point.

## More decimal places is not always better
- Extra decimal places imply more precise results but are usually unnecessary and distracting.
- Round your numbers off before plotting.

## Convey your message with both form and function
- Removing all artistic elements will make your visualization boring.
- Having too much artistic elements may distract the audience from the data and the message it conveys.
- Add labels and titles.

## Don't use 3D if your data isn't 3D
- 3D is visually appealing but can make your chart hard to read and understand.
- Unless you are plotting something that is actually 3D (e.g. elevation), stick to 2D charts.

## Not everything needs a chart
- Why use charts when you can use numbers directly?
- Why use charts when you can use bullet points?
