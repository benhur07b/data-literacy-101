# Knowing your users

## There isn’t a single type of data user
- We should **move away from the data user stereotypes**. Data users aren't limited to IT people, “nerds”, or those with no social skills.
- The field of data is **diverse and inclusive**.
- Data users come in **different shapes, sizes, and skills**.
- Different data users also have **different needs**.
- One important step in building data culture is understanding what type of data users you have.
