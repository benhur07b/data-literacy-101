# Data socialization
Data Socialization is the combination of **sharing and widening data skills** from the basics to intermediary, while **fostering a data culture**.

## How do we start socializing?
### Skills Scoping
- Getting a baseline understanding of the skills and opportunities for an organization -- make people talk about data, what skills they want to learn or share, etc.

### Informal Data Working Group
- Can also be called Meetups. Open to everyone where people are free to share and learn new data skills (initially based on the outcomes of the Skills Scoping).

### People Before Data
Create spaces for conversations and giving everyone equal access to explore their data skills.

### Track people's progress and iterate
Building data literacy and learning data skills take time. It is an investment on the part of the individual and the organization and involves checking both individual and organizational progress, evaluating the success of interventions, and adapting to the results accordingly.
