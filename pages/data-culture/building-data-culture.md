# Building a culture of data

Having a culture of data means that:
- Data is integral and central to your day to day operations and isnâ€™t just an afterthought.
- Data is embedded and part of your organization's identity.

**Building data culture and data literacy is hard and does not happen overnight.** It is a long and, often, ardous process. **There are no shortcuts**. There will be a lot of stumbling blocks and learning experiences along the way but both the journey and destination are worth it.

Along the way, an organization hoping to build a culture of data and build data literacy must:

**1. Use data as evidence.**

- Data, when used as evidence, can lead to **better and non-arbitrary** policies and decisions.
- Evidence-based decision-making requires:
    - a sound theory
    - a coherent set of testable hypotheses
    - a robust dataset to validate and refine the hypotheses

**4. [Knows its users.](knowing-your-users.html)**

**5. [Empowers members to learn, improve, and share their data skills.](data-socialization.html)**
