ODK is a suite of open source tools that help organizations collect and manage data. It consists of:
- **ODK Collect** - open source Android app for **data collection** that replaces paper forms used in survey-based data gathering.
- **ODK Central** - the **ODK server** that manages user accounts and permissions, stores form definitions, and allows data collection clients like ODK Collect to connect to it for form download and submission upload.
- **ODK Build** - a drag-and-drop **form designer**.

A common workflow using ODK:
- Create survey forms using the XLSForm standard in Excel or Google Sheets.
- Upload forms to an ODK Central server.
- Download forms into ODK Collect on an Android device.
- Use Collect to fill out forms with participants.
- Upload survey data from Collect to Central.
- Analyze or export data from Central.

ODK-X is another free and open source toolkit to come out of the Open Data Kit projectâ€”the same one that created ODK. Compared to ODK, ODK-X is less mature but it is a more flexible and more complex tool suite.

ODK-X allows you to create your own data management applications consisting of survey forms and Javascript-based apps that can render a fully customizable user interface to gather, manage, and visualize data on an Android device.

The ODK-X Tool Suite consists of:

- **ODK-X Survey**- a customizable **data collection** application.
- **ODK-X Tables** - a **data curation and visualization** application that can also run custom-built data collection workflows.
- **ODK-X Services** - an application for **user authentication and data synchronization** between the ODK-X applications.
- **ODK-X Cloud Endpoints** - a **cloud server** to host data and application files, and to support bi-directional data synchronization across mobile devices.
- **ODK-X Suitcase** - a **desktop tool for synchronizing data** with a cloud endpoint.
- **ODK-X Application Designer** - a **design environment** for creating, customizing, and previewing your forms, data curation, and visualization applications. This is where you **build your ODK-X applications**.

A common data collection workflow using ODK-X:
- ODK-X Application Designer for data collection form creation
- ODK-X Survey for data collection
- ODK-X Services for data sync and database access
- ODK-X Cloud Endpoints for data and application files cloud server
