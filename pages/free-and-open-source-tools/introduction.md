# Free and open source tools

## What is this module about?
This module will focus primarily in free (as in freedom) and open source tools. Some proprietary but free (as in cost) tools will also be included. 

You should be familiar with the concept of free and open source software, proprietary software, and freeware.
- **Free software** refer to software that abide by the [Four Essential Freedoms of Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)—freedom to run, to study, to redistribute, and to distribute copies of your modified versions. This is what we refer to when we say `free (as in freedom)`. That's not to say that free software is not free in terms of cost. In fact, being easily accessible—i.e. no additional cost to download and install—is a fundamental characteristic of free software.
- **Open source software** refer to software that are under an open source license and complies with the [open source definition](https://opensource.org/osd). They are often used synonymously with free software—being open source is a requirement for a software to be free.
- **Proprietary software** generally refer to software that restrict what the user can do with the software—this includes restricting access to the source code, requiring a payment or subscription to use the software, preventing users from sharing copies of the software, etc. These software are under a proprietary license.
- **Freeware** refer to software that are available for use at no monetary cost. This can include, and usually are, proprietary software. These kinds of freeware cannot be considered to fall under the definition of free software or open source software. This is what we refer to when we say `free (as to cost)`.
