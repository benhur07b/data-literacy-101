## Beware of openwashing
```yaml remark
type: success
text: <strong>Openwashing</strong><ul><li>To spin a product or company as open, although it is not. Derived from 'greenwashing.' (<a href="https://michellethorne.cc/2009/03/openwashing/">Michelle Thorn</a>)</li><li>Having an appearance of open-source and open-licensing for marketing purposes, while continuing proprietary practices.

```

Just because an organization or agency says they are open not actually mean that they are.
