# Define
Data-driven projects always have a “define the problem you’re trying to solve” component. It’s in this stage you start asking questions and come around the issues that will matter in the end. Defining your problem means going from a theme to one or multiple specific questions that can be answered by data. Being specific forces you to think about the data you need and the kinds of analyses and presentations you need to do which then helps you to scope your project: Is the data needed easily available? Are there some key datasets that may be hard to get?

## Things to consider
### Formulating the Research Question(s) properly
```yaml remark
type: success
text: <strong>Important&#58;</strong> A project does not need to be a "research" project to have a research question.
```

Data-driven projects are, by nature, investigative and seek to answer questions. 

If the end result of a project is a visualization or a dashboard, the research questions will help guide your thinking about what should be visualized or displayed on the dashboard. This is important because [data visualizations (e.g. dashboards) are meant to communicate information](present.html) and a dashboard that justs displays whatever data is available would be useless. If the result being sought is an advocacy campaign, then the research question will help focus on the message that the campaign aims to highlight. 

By starting with a question or questions, we also mitigate our tendency to design the project by based on a predefined answer or solution: yes, we know that COVID-19 affected procurement but we don't know the extent, duration, or impact of said effect. 

### Identifying the scope and challenges of the project
Since a data-driven project relies so much on data, it is important that the challenges related to data are identified and understood from the start. This includes challenges in finding or getting the data needed for the project such as an unresponsive or uncooperative government agency or doing data collection in remote areas. A properly formulated research question will highlight the scope of the project and the data needed, allowing you to get an initial understanding of the challenges involved in acquiring the data.

```yaml remark
type: success
text: For example, the theme "impact of COVID-19 on public procurement in the Philippines" can be broken down into:<br><strong>Question 1 -</strong> Are there significant differences between the prices of the commonly procured items during the pandemic and their prices pre-pandemic?<ul><li><strong>Specific question 1.1 -</strong> What are the most commonly procured items during COVID-19?</li><li><strong>Specific question 1.2 -</strong> At what price are these items currently being procured?</li><li><strong>Specific question 1.3 -</strong> At what price were they being procured before COVID-19?</li><li><strong>Specific question 1.4 -</strong> Are there differences in the prices and are they significant?</li></ul>
```

## Common issues
### Proceeding with a data-driven project without a research question
A good research question helps guide the project in both output and scope. It is an essential element to understand what the project is aiming to accomplish. **A project can have several research questions but having none shows a lack of rigor or direction for the project.**

```yaml remark
type: warning
text: <strong>Typical consequences include&#58;</strong><ul><li>Dashboards designed around the data instead of the target audience.</li><li>Delayed projects due to bad scope management.</li><li>Difficulty to pivot the project if some of the expected data is not available.</li></ul>
```

### Bad scoping
Properly formulating research questions help with scoping the project in terms of the data needed. However, this will be for naught if you fail to account for other variables linked to the sources of data, its quality, and its accessibility.

```yaml remark
type: warning
text: <strong>Typical consequences include&#58;</strong><ul><li>Lack of anticipation of the difficulty of getting access to data held by a government agency, leading to delays in the project delivery.</li><li>verestimation of the quality of the data held by governments, leading to a lowering of the ambition of the project.</li><li>Not taking into account the logistical challenges of mobilizing stakeholders.</li><li>Underestimating the time needed to clean a dataset manually, leading to delays and/or a less rigorous process.</li><li>Not including the time needed to document properly the methodology.</li></ul>
